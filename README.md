# About

Built a model to predict whether each of the images on a Webpage is an Advertisement or Article Content

# Objective: 
Create a model for Identifying Advertisement in a Webpage
# Steps and tasks:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Find a good predicting model for finding Advertisement in a Webpage


# Contents
This is a Webpage Data set. This Data set contain 3279 rows and 1559 columns.

* For predicting Advertisement in a Webpage, I developed and compared various models.

For Creating a model i Used
1) Decision Tree.
2) Random Forest Classification

 
# Result:
From these models Random Forest Classification model gives highest accuracy when compared to Decision Tree model(0.98).

# Tools Used

1) Python
2) Pandas
3) Scikit-learn
4) Matplotlib
5) Numpy
6) Jupyter Notebook
